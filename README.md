This is a Python project bootstrapped with [python/flask-hello-world](https://vercel.com/new/templates/python/flask-hello-world). It surfaces an API to be used as the "Request Url" endpoint for a Slack App, called Buddy Up.

The Buddy Up app's primary purpose is to facilitate 1-1 meetups within a Slack channel. The core scenario is to automatically match users in a Slack channel once a month via a message, something like the message shown below:
